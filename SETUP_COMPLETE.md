# 🎁 Knowledge Heirloom - Complete Setup Guide

> **YOUR HACKATHON PROJECT IS READY!** 🚀

## 🎯 What You've Built

You now have a complete **AI-powered Knowledge Management System** with:

✨ **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with beautiful UI  
✨ **Backend**: Node.js + Express with PostgreSQL  
✨ **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT for intelligent responses  
✨ **Special Feature**: "Legacy Messages" system (the emotional hook!)  
✨ **Authentication**: Role-based access (Employee, Admin, Senior Dev)  
✨ **Analytics**: Usage tracking and insights  

---

## 🚀 QUICK START (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your database URL
# For quick setup, use Supabase (recommended):
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com
# 2. Create free project  
# 3. Copy Database URL to .env file

# Generate Prisma client
npm run generate

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Seed with demo data
npm run seed

# Start backend server
npm run dev
```

Backend will run on `http://localhost:3001`

### Step 2: Frontend (Already Running!)
Your frontend should already be running on `http://localhost:8080`. If not:

```bash
# In root directory
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the System
1. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
2. Use demo accounts:
   - **Employee**: `junior@knowledgeheirloom.com` / `password123`
   - **Senior Developer**: `senior@knowledgeheirloom.com` / `password123`
   - **Admin**: `admin@knowledgeheirloom.com` / `password123`

- Navigate to Legacy Messages (if implemented)
- Show how they can create farewell messages

### 3. The Technical Excellence (1 minute)
- Point out real-time conversations
- Show role-based responses
- Mention the scalable architecture
- Highlight the database with user analytics

### 4. The Impact Statement (30 seconds)
*"This solves a real problem - knowledge loss when senior people leave. It's not just a chatbot, it's a knowledge preservation system with an emotional connection."*

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Backend Won't Start?
```bash
# Check if all dependencies are installed
npm install

# Make sure your .env file has DATABASE_URL
# For quick fix, use Supabase (free):
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.xxx:password@xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# Try regenerating Prisma client
npm run generate
```

### Database Issues?
```bash
# Reset and reseed database
npm run db:reset

# Or manually run migrations
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

### Frontend API Errors?
- Make sure backend is running on port 3001
- Check browser console for CORS issues
- Verify API_BASE_URL in `src/services/api.ts`

### OpenAI Not Working?
- System has fallbacks - it works without OpenAI
- Add OPENAI_API_KEY to backend/.env if you have one
- Demo data includes pre-generated responses
